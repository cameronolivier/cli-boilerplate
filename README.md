# My CLI Tool Boilerplate

## Overview
This is a boilerplate project for building CLI tools using TypeScript. It includes:

- TypeScript configuration for building modern Node.js applications.
- A basic CLI structure using [commander](https://github.com/tj/commander.js) for handling commands.
- Interactive prompts via [inquirer](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js).
- Colorful terminal output via [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk).
- Coding standards enforced using ESLint and code formatting with Prettier.
- Commands to easily publish your CLI tool to NPM.
- Guidance on creating and pushing a GitHub repository.

## Hat-Tips
This boilerplate leans heavily on the fantastic article by [@mattpocockuk](https://x.com/mattpocockuk) on [How to Create an NPM package]
(https://www.totaltypescript.com/how-to-create-an-npm-package) for the initial setup. 

## Project Structure
```text
my-cli-tool/
├── src/
│   ├── commands/
│   └── utils/
├── .gitignore
├── .eslintrc.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── package.json
├── prettier.config.js
├── README.md
└── LICENSE
```

- **src/commands/**: This folder is where you define the core command functions, such as branch creation or commit management.
- **src/utils/**: Helper utility functions, like fuzzy searching, go here.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-cli-tool
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start Development**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
    - This runs the CLI using `ts-node`, allowing you to develop and test your commands without needing to rebuild.

4. **Build the Project**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
    - This will compile your TypeScript code to JavaScript in the `dist` directory.

5. **Link Locally**
   ```bash
   npm link
   ```
    - This allows you to use the command globally as `my-cli` while still making changes locally.

## Best Practices

- **Command Organization**: Place core commands in `src/commands/`. Use descriptive names for your files to ensure clarity (e.g., `branch.ts` for branch-related commands).
- **Utilities**: Keep reusable utility functions in `src/utils/`. This promotes modularity and helps keep your command functions clean.
- **Prettier & ESLint**: Before committing your code, always run `npm run format` to ensure consistent code style.

## Adding New Commands
To add a new command:
1. Create a new file in `src/commands/`.
2. Define your command logic there.
3. Register the new command in `src/index.ts` using the `commander` API.

Example:
```typescript
program
  .command('new-command')
  .description('Description of the new command')
  .action(() => {
    // Command logic
  });
```

## Publishing to NPM
To publish your CLI as an NPM package:
1. **Build the Project**: Run `npm run build`.
2. **Login to NPM**: Run `npm login` and enter your credentials.
3. **Publish**: Run `npm publish`.

After publishing, your CLI will be available for installation via:
```bash
npm install -g my-cli-tool
```

## Creating a GitHub Repository
To initialize a Git repository and push the project to GitHub:
1. **Initialize Git**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
2. **Create a new repository on GitHub** (use GitHub interface or CLI).
3. **Add GitHub Remote and Push**
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my-cli-tool.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## License
Include a `LICENSE` file to specify the licensing terms for your project.
